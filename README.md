# firstrepo

This repository marks my first step in learning GitHub. I am using it to practice version control, explore Git features, and build good development habits.

My goals with this repository are:

Learn how to create and manage repositories

Practice committing, branching, and merging

Get familiar with collaboration workflows

Build a foundation for future projects

I am excited to keep learning and improving as I grow my skills in software development and version control.
